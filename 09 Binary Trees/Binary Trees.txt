Binary Trees
- It's hiearchical data structure 
- Each node has at-most two pointers for its children (left and right) 
- Height of the tree denotes the number of levels
- Tree problems follow a recursive structure.
- Mostly all problems can be solved ny dividing the problem into 
subproblems and making recursive calls on subtrees or iteratively
