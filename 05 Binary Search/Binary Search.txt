- Space complexity of simple binary search algorithms 
depends upon the implementation is recursive O(LogN) 
or iterative O(1).
- Ternary Search does more comparisons than Binary Search 
in worst case.
- Binary search is a divide and conquer algorithm: We divide 
the problem into smaller problem, hence its D&C.
- Binary Search is applied on Monotonic Searchspaces, 
not just arrays.
