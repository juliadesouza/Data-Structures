Recursion
- Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution 
to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of) itself.
- It forms a tree structure.
- To solve recursion problem, do:
    1. Figure of the smallest case.
    2. Always assume the subproblem can be solved.
    3. Solve the current problem assuming subproblem solution exists.
- Example: we can define the operation "Go to home" as:
    Base Case 
        1. If you are at home, stop moving.
    Recursive Case
        2. Take one step toward home.
        3. "Go to home".

// a simple recursive function
    void goHome(x, home){
        if(x==home){
            print("Reached home");
            return;
        }

        x = x+1;
        goHome(x, home);
    }

// main
    int x = 1;
    int home = 10;
    goHome(x,home);
