Important data structure for pattern matching problems.
Prefix Trie
- Generic tree like data stricture
- Efficient information retrieval data structure
- Searches in optimal time O(key length) but uses extra storage.
- Important operations:
    * insert
    * Search
- It storages commong prefixes in the same "branch"
Sample Problem - given a list of strings and Q queries, 
each query containing a word, you have to tell whether 
the word is contained in the list or not.
