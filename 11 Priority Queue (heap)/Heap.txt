- Heap its a binary where all the levels are completed
filled except last level.
- There are two types of heaps:
    * Max Heap: every node must be greater than its children.
    * Min Heap: every node must be less than its children.
- Push: O(logN)
- Pop Min / Pop Max: O(logN)
- Get Min / Get Max: O(1)
- Building a heap tales O(n) time
- HeapSort takes O(nlogn) time
- Getting the minimun element from the heap takes O(1) time (in min heap)
- Height of the Heap containing n element is always O(logN)
- In a binary max heap containing N integers, the smallest element can be found in O(n)
- Heap Sort's memory usage is minimal
- The Heap sort algorithm is extremely efficient
- The Heap sort algorithm exhibits consistent performance
- In a max heap, the smallest element is always present at a leaf node. So we need to check for all leaf nodes for the minimum value. Worst case complexity will be O(n)
