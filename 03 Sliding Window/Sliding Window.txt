Sliding Window Problems
- It's useful for solving problem in arrau and string, specially 
it's considered as technique that could reduco time complexity 
from O(nË†2) to O(n)
- In this case, you have contract from one side and expand from git
the other side (like a sliding window).
- Types:
    - Fixed window length: the length of the window is fixed and it's 
    asks you to find something in the window.
    - Two Pointers + Criteria: the window size is not fixed, usually It
    asks you to find the subarray that meets the criteria.

- Sliding Window Techniques are useful to use because:
    * reduce time complexity for many problems 
    * reduce space complexity for many problems
- Most sliding window problems can be solved in O(N) time and O(1) space complexity
